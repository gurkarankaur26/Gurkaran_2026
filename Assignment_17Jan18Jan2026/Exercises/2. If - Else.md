## Device impurity formula for a set with only two classes given the counts of each class.
**Topic:** *Devise Your Own Impurity Formula*

### **Explanation (Simple Terms)**

When we try to split data into two groups in machine learning (especially in decision trees), we want to know how “mixed” a set is — meaning how many items from different classes are in the same set. This “mixed-ness” is called *impurity*.

* If all the items are from the **same class**, the set is **pure** — impurity is **0**.
* If the items are **equally split between two classes**, the set is **maximally impure** — impurity is **high**.

You might have heard of common impurity measures like **Gini Index** or **Entropy**, but in this exercise, you will **create your own** formula for impurity using the counts of the two classes.

---

### **Exercise**

Write a function `my_impurity(c1, c2)` that calculates the impurity of a set containing two classes:

* `c1` is the number of examples from **class 1**
* `c2` is the number of examples from **class 2**

You should **devise your own formula** to calculate impurity. Your formula must meet these conditions:

1. If all items are from one class (`c1 = 0` or `c2 = 0`), impurity should be `0`.
2. The impurity should increase as the classes become more evenly balanced.
3. The impurity should be **maximum** when `c1 == c2`.

You may use arithmetic operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and functions like `abs()` if needed.

### **Function Signature**

```python
def my_impurity(c1, c2):
    # your formula here
    return impurity_value
```

---

### **Example Usage**

Assuming you devise this impurity formula:
`impurity = (2 * min(c1, c2)) / (c1 + c2)`

Then:

```python
my_impurity(0, 5)     # Output: 0.0
my_impurity(5, 5)     # Output: 1.0
my_impurity(7, 3)     # Output: 0.6
my_impurity(9, 1)     # Output: 0.2
```

Try a few formulas. Test and compare their outputs. Pick one that makes sense to you and meets the conditions above.

**Bonus Challenge:**
Can you design a formula that gives values between 0 and 1 **and** changes smoothly with the ratio of the classes?
