## Given two points, write a function fit() to learn slope and intercept of the line going through them

### **Topic:** *Learn Line Equation from Two Points*

### **Explanation:**

A straight line in a 2D plane can be described by the equation:

$$
y = mx + c
$$

Where:

* `m` is the **slope** of the line.
* `c` is the **intercept** — the value of `y` when `x = 0`.

If you're given **two points** on the line, say `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, you can calculate the **slope** `m` the intercept `c`.

Since, the equation of line is y = mx + c. If we put the two point into it, we get two equations in m and c.

y1 = m * x1 + c
y2 = m * x2 + c

We can solve these two equations.

For example, if your two points are (1, 2) and (3, 6), we would get two equations:

2 = m + c
6 = 3m + c

We can solve these equations by elimination:

* Slope: subtract first equation from second, 2m = 4, m = 2
* Intercept: put value of m in first equation, `2 - (2 × 1) = 0`
* So, the equation of the line is: `y = 2x + 0`

### **Exercise:**

Write a function `fit(x1, y1, x2, y2)` that returns a tuple `(m, c)` representing the slope and intercept of the line passing through the two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`.

---

### **Function Signature:**

```python
def fit(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Your code here
```

---

### **Example:**

```python
fit(1, 2, 3, 6)       # Output: (2.0, 0.0)
fit(0, 5, 2, 9)       # Output: (2.0, 5.0)
```

> 💡 **Hint:** Make sure `x1` is not equal to `x2`, otherwise the slope would be undefined (vertical line). You may handle this case as you see fit.


## find first derivaative of a function that takes only one argument. 

### **Topic:** *Find First Derivative of a Function*

#### **Simple Explanation:**

In mathematics, the *derivative* of a function tells us how fast the function's value is changing at a particular point.

Think of it like this: if you’re driving a car and your distance changes every second, then your speed is the derivative of your distance. Similarly, for any function, the derivative gives the *rate of change*.

We’ll use a simple numerical technique called the **difference method**:

$$
f'(x) \approx \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}
$$

This is called the **forward difference method**, where `h` is a very small number.

---

### **Exercise:**

Write a function `approx_derivative(func, x, h)` that:

* Takes a function `func` that accepts a single argument,
* A value `x` where we want to find the derivative,
* And a small number `h` (like `0.0001`),
* Returns the approximate derivative of `func` at `x`.

---

### **Example Usage:**

```python
def square(x):
    return x * x

def cube(x):
    return x * x * x

print(approx_derivative(square, 3, 0.0001))  # Output: Approx. 6
print(approx_derivative(cube, 2, 0.0001))    # Output: Approx. 12
```

---

### **Note to Learner:**

Try different values of `x` and different functions (like `math.sin`, `math.exp`, etc.) to see how the derivative changes.

Make sure to import any libraries (like `math`) if needed.
