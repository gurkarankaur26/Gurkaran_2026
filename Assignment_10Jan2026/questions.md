4. Add/subtract single digit in your base
base - 12
0, 1, .... 9, A, B
10,        19, 1A, 1B, 
20, 

1 + 1 = 2
8 + 1 = 9
9 + 1 = A
9 + 2 = B
9 + 3 = 10


9 + 9 = 9 + 3 + 6 = 10 + 6 = 16
A + A = A + 2 + 8 = 10 + 8 = 18
9 + 1 + 9 + 1 = 16 + 2 = 18
8 + 7 = 13

B - 1 = A
B - 2 = 9
A - 1 = 9
A - 2 = 8

6. Write strategy to print next number in a number system. A system is a sequence of symbols
next_number(symbols="0123456789AB", "1") -> 2
next_number(symbols="0123456789AB", "B") -> 10
next_number(symbols="0123456789AB", "111") -> 112
next_number(symbols="0123456789AB", "BB") -> 100
next_number(symbols="0123456789AB", "ABAB") -> ABB0

0123456789AB
    A + 1 = B
    B + 2 = 11

print first n digits numbers in symbols="0123456789AB"
    next_number(symbols="0123456789AB", "0") -> 1
    next_number(symbols="0123456789AB", "1") -> 2
    ..
    n times

8. Write an strategy to add two numbers of multiple digits in your base.

Prompt: 
    Write an code to add two numbers of multiple digits in any base represented by symbols
    add_two_numbers(symbols="0123456789AB", "11", "1B") -> "30"
    add_two_numbers(symbols="0123456789AB", "1119", "BB") -> "1218"

add_two_numbers(symbols="0123456789AB", "11", "1B") -> "30"
add_two_numbers(symbols="0123456789AB", "1119", "BB") -> "1218"

# Base4
add_two_numbers(symbols="0123", "11", "12") -> "23"
add_two_numbers(symbols="0123", "11", "33") -> "110"

9. Subtract two numbers at least 5 pairs.

10. Multiplication
A. Multiply single digits
Base 7
2 * 1 = 2
2 * 2 = 4
2 * 3 = 6
2 * 4 = 11 = 6 + 2
2 * 5 = 13 = 11 + 2
2 * 6 = 15 = 13 + 2

3 * 1 = 3
    2 = 6
    3 = 12
    4 = 15
    5 = 21
    6 = 24

[2, 3, 4, 5, 6] * [2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

2 * 3 = 3 * 2

B. Multiply multiple digits

base 7
15 * 34 = 606
26 * 14 = 433
45 * 34 = 2256

Q: Write code to prepare the tables as array of base * base - 2D list containing your table.
base 7 - 0*0 to 6*6 (49)

If you are not good with code yet,
    1. Write down the strategy to solve a problem
    2. Get chatgpt to code it for you. Make the code run. 
    3. Go through stepwise in the code and try to understand what's going on there  - put the print statements.
    4. Compare your strategy in step 1 with chatgpt's strategy.

Q: Write code to multiply numbers, you can use the tables and add_two_numbers()

multiply("15", "34") -> 606

Q: What is the minimum base possible? Is the negative base makes sense? Is base 0 makes sense? 
Justify your answers.

Ans: 
A. 2
0
1
10
11
100
101
110
111
...

B. 1 (Tally)
